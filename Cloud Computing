Cloud Computing Architecture
Cloud Computing Architecture comprises many cloud components, each of which is
loosely coupled. We can broadly divide the cloud architecture into two parts:
Front End:
Front End refers to the client part of the computing system. It consists of interfaces
and applications that are required to access the computing platforms. Example: Web
Browser
Back End:
Back End refers to the cloud itself. It consists of all the resources required to provide
cloud computing services. It comprises huge Data Storage, Virtual Machines, Security
mechanisms, Services, Deployment Models, Servers, etc.
